## Project Summary

Welcome to PokePort, a one-stop destination for all your Pokémon card needs! We've created this unique online platform with one clear mission in mind - to make buying Pokémon cards as easy, fun, and accessible as possible for enthusiasts worldwide.

### Target Audience & User Goals

## User Stories and Pain Points

A Pokémon card enthusiast lives in a remote area with no access to local game shops. PokePort allows him to explore a vast catalogue of cards and purchase them conveniently from the comfort of his home.

A mother wants to surprise her child with a rare Pokémon card for his birthday but has no idea where to start. PokePort's user-friendly interface and comprehensive search functions enable her to find the perfect card, and the community section helps her understand the value and significance of the card she is buying.

A seasoned collector is seeking to purchase a highly sought-after limited edition card. With PokePort's robust security measures, he can make his purchase with confidence, knowing that the card is authentic and his transaction is secure.

## UI/UX Elements

My SQL database was meticulously planned for, and the reflection of that planning can be found in my ERD Diagram and Logical Schema diagram.

## Limitations and Future Implementations

Some possible features I would like to implement in the future are:
- Trading system: trade with others
